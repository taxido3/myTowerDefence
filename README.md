# myTowerDefence
  
The last project i have worked on

The last project i have worked on, was a final exercise for the javacourse of my academy. The exersice includes the following challenges:

1. GUI with JavaFX
2. At least 2 scenes, with stored and delivered data from the first scene to the next
3. A connection to a databank
4. Load and save from/into a table of the databank
5. Varios bottons and mouse-click-events
6. The code had to be organised after a variation of MVC  

We only had three days. Monday was a hollyday, friday we had to present. The shape, interface and usage of the Java-application was for us to choose.

My idea was to build a towerdefence-game from the scratch, especially because i asume, that i would never have the time, reson and opportunity again to build something like this realy from the scratch
and only out of my ideas. As i see it, its much more common, to build up on pre-existing frameworks and engines, which is much more efficent (you dont have to invent the wheele everytime again)
but as i see it, its better to know which problems this frameworks and engines solves exactly. A way to realy know about them, is to have and solve them by them selfe. Pretty sure, my solutions werent the best,
but there were my solutions and i got to understand (and feel) the problems. I strongly believe, this is the best and most what you can get out of such an exersice without any steakholder, then myselfe.

A towerdefence-game has three major challenges:
  1. An editor, to build your tower, free on a grid (in my case:
